--
--   However long lived applications that set and remove many watches
--   should still endeavor to avoid calling `rmWatch` on removed

--   The (small) downside to this behavior is that it also ignores the
--   case when,  for some slightly strange reason, 'rmWatch' is called
--   on a file descriptor that is not an inotify descriptor.

-- | Stops watching a path for changes.  This version throws an exception
--   on @EINVAL@,  so it is not ok to delete a non-existant watch
--   descriptor.   Therefore this function is not thread safe,  even
--   if it's only ever called from a single thread.
--
--   The problem is that in some cases the kernel will automatically
--   delete a watch descriptor.  Although the kernel generates an
--   @IN_IGNORED@ event whenever a descriptor is deleted,  it's
--   possible that using @rmWatch'@ and @getEvent@ in different threads
--   would delete the descriptor after the kernel has delivered the
--   @IN_IGNORED@ event but before your application has acted on the
--   message.
--
--   It may not even be safe to call this function from the thread
--   that is calling @getEvent@.  I need to investigate whether or
--   not the kernel would return @EINVAL@ on a descriptor before
--   the @IN_IGNORED@ message has been delivered to your application.
--   This would make rmWatch' somewhat safer in the presence of threads,
--   but the application would still have to ensure that all delivered
--   events are processed before rmWatch' is called.
